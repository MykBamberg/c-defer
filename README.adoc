== Defer in C

This header file presents a practical way to use the implementation of a `defer` keyword as shown in the https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3434.htm[WG14 document n3434 "`Even simpler defer for direct integration`"]. Accompanying the implementation are examples showcasing the function and possible use cases of the keyword.

The `defer` keyword deferrs the execution of a code block to the point at which the current scope is exited from. This is equivalent to the `defer` keywords in other languages such as Go, Swift, Odin, Zig, and scope guards in D.
